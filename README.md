This work is carried over from previous template: https://github.com/CoreyFedde/capstone-front

Concept: Web app containing easy to use financial wellness tools that help users visualize loans and interest payments, retirement investing, and general finances like rent-to-income.
Stack: SQL -> Rails -> Ember

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, Ember
Ember is a frontend framework similar to Angular. It focuses on components and
routing views through changing the url, but not loading seperate pages.

General Approach:
My approach to the frontend of this project was to build out a basic client with
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to test the CRUD capabilities on my backend.

After confirming that my client and server side resources could communicate, I
switched gears and created an Ember template in order to learn the basics of a
frontend framework. Ember was a new technology for me and I was impressed by the
concept of routing and how it is able to change the view without forcing the
browser to load more resources. Likewise, the component element of the framework
started to make the development process easier the more familiar with it I
became.

However, learning Ember also forced me to slow down and be more methodical.
There is no doubt that I would have gained more exposure to D3 and other
technologies if I had not used the framework, but I think the knowledge I gained
from the experience is worth it.

My next steps will be to review what is left of the original plan for the web
app and how I can implement it over the next month.

Unsolved problems:
Many areas of this web app still need to be completed. Myy biggest hurdle was
learning to use Ember and it's routing. Now that this is mainly setup, I will
be tackling graphing the data using the D3 JavaScript library and finding new
ways to give more transparent data about potential loans for users.

Installation instructions:
NPM Install and Bower Install after fork and clone.

User stories:
As a user, I want to be able to...
"visualize loans with principal + interest rates"
"visualize how much my rent takes up from my income"
"compare my finances to others in country, state, age group"
"visualize the retirement investing"
"compare paying down loans to investing in stocks or index funds"
"share my loans and retirements with other users"
